# 🌱 Welcome to the world of Data

Dear Student,

Welcome to your journey into the world of **MySQL** — a foundational skill for every aspiring software engineer, backend developer, or data professional.

Learning databases isn’t just about writing queries — it's about learning to **ask the right questions**, **organize the truth**, and **manage information** with precision and care.

I’ve designed this course as a **story** — not a sprint through syntax, but a structured growth journey. We will walk through the *why*, *how*, and *when* of using databases in real-world applications.

## 🧭 What You’ll Learn

From the very basics of MySQL syntax to the deeper understanding of triggers, transactions, and stored procedures, this guide will help you:

- Build strong foundations in **DBMS principles**
- Understand the power of **SQL queries**
- Master **data relationships** using JOINS
- Automate backend logic with **Stored Procedures & Triggers**
- Ensure consistency with **Transactions & Locking**
- Design better systems through **Normalization & Optimization**

## 🗂️ Learning Path Overview

Here’s how your journey is structured — each topic builds on the previous one:
 
<p>Before starting a learning journey, let us understand todays world</p> 

- [Artificial Intelligence](notes/ai.md)   
- [ Story of Data ](notes/datastory.md) 
- [Schema Design & Optimization](notes/datatointelligence.md)  
- [Data Science ](notes/datascience.md)
- [Data Engineering](notes/dataengineering.md)  
- [Digesting Data](notes/dataingestion.md)

<P>Let us start with Basics</p>

- [MySQL Syntax & Setup](notes/stepbystepinstallation.md)  👉Install MySQL, learn basic commands 
- [Core DBMS Concepts](notes/dbms.md) 👉 What is a database? Understanding its backbone 
- [Schema Design & Optimization](notes/normalizationdenormalizaiton.md)  👉Normalize or denormalize? Learn to choose wisely 
- [Multi-table Data Retrieval (JOINS)](notes/joins.md)👉 Retrieve and combine data from related tables 
- [Transactions](notes/transactions.md)  👉 Manage real-time access & avoid conflicts 
- [Functions](notes/functionsvsstoredproc.md) 👉 Understand how logic can be reused and abstracted 
- [Stored Procedures](notes/storedprocedure.md) 👉Learn to automate business rules 

- [Triggers](notes/triggers.md) 👉Automate reactions to data changes 
- [Practice SQL File](notes/test.sql) 👉Hands-on file to try out everything you've learned 
 
## 🛠️ Who Should Use This?

Whether you're a:

- Student building your first project,
- Developer brushing up on fundamentals,
- Or an engineer preparing for interviews...

...this path is made for **hands-on learning**, **concept clarity**, and **real-world readiness**.

## 🚀 Let’s Begin

> “Don’t just learn to write queries. Learn to think in data.”

Are you ready? Then let’s start by setting up your MySQL environment and writing your first query!
